# Invesddit - A Finance Related Content Aggregation and Discussion Website

## Summary

Invesddit is a finance related content aggregation and discussion website. While there are a variety of finance related forums across the web (e.g., [Stockhouse.com](https://www.stockhouse.com), [TheCoBF.com](https://thecobf.com), [ValueInvestorsClub.com](https://valueinvestorsclub.com)), the user interfaces tend to be dated and features are limited. All-in-all, these websites are in need of an update!

As part of the final project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-javascript-final-project), I was tasked with replicating one of my favorite websites as closely as possible. For my final project I wanted to build a competitor to these finance forums with an updated user interface and rich set of features, all inspired by one of my favorite websites - Reddit.

As a result, Invesddit was born!

## Set up

### Using Web Brower

The simplest way to view Invesddit is live on Github at https://ayrt-n.github.io/invesddit/

Please note that it may take 30-45 seconds for the Heroku dyno to start up if the application has been inactive for awhile.

### Using Local Machine

If you want to run Invesddit locally on your own machine, you will first need to clone and set up the backend API by following the instructions in the associated repo [here](https://github.com/ayrt-n/invesddit-api).

After setting up the backend and starting the server, clone this repo into a fresh directory, navigate to that directoy, and run:

```npm start```

A browser window should now open up with the application running on the frontend. If your browser does not automatically open, simply open a browser tab and navigate to http://localhost:3000

You should now have your own copy of Invesddit running locally on your own machine!
