# Invesddit - A Finance Related Content Aggregation and Discussion Website

## Overview

Invesddit is a finance related content aggregation and discussion website. While there are a variety of finance related forums across the web (e.g., [Stockhouse.com](https://www.stockhouse.com), [TheCoBF.com](https://thecobf.com), [ValueInvestorsClub.com](https://valueinvestorsclub.com)), the user interfaces tend to be dated and features are limited. All-in-all, these websites are in need of an update!

As part of the final project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-javascript-final-project), I was tasked with replicating one of my favorite websites as closely as possible. For my final project I wanted to build a competitor to these finance forums with an updated user interface and rich set of features, all inspired by one of my favorite websites - Reddit. As a result, Invesddit was born!
